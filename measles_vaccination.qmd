title: Final Project - Change in measles related deaths in children with vaccination coverage
author: Özlem Türkmen Recen

In this project I aim to investigate relation between measles-related death in children and vaccine hesitency and vaccine coverage
All data provided from gapminder


```{python}
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import country_converter as coco
```

# Investigating datasets 

## Deaths of measles  in children

```{python}
death_measles = pd.read_csv('data/measles_deaths_in_children.csv') #Imported data of measles death of children between 1 and 59 months 1990-2019
death_all = pd.read_csv('data/all_causes_deaths.csv') #Imported data of measles death of children between 1 and 59 months #All deaths only has 2008 so I can't see proportion of masles related death in all death in timeframe
death_measles_birth = pd.read_csv('data/measles_deaths_in_children_births.csv')
 #Also only in 2008
```

## Measles vaccine coverage

```{python}
mcv1_cov = pd.read_csv('data/mcv1_vacc.csv') #1980-2023
mcv2_cov = pd.read_csv('data/mcv2_vacc.csv') #2000-2023
```

## Vaccine hesitency among parents 

```{python}
safety = pd.read_csv('data/vccin_sfty_dag.csv') #2015-2018 (No data in 2016 and 17)
importance = pd.read_csv('data/vccine_imptn_dag.csv') #2015-2018 (No data in 2016 and 17)
effective = pd.read_csv('data/vccin_effect_dag.csv')
```

## Investigate
Check the first few rows of each dataset using .head().
Identify missing values with .isnull().sum().
Standardize column names if needed.

```{python}
death_measles.head()
death_measles_long = death_measles.melt(id_vars='country')
```
